{"name":"Thinstation","tagline":"A framework for making thin and light Linux based images for x86 based machines and thinclients.","body":"![Connectivity](Ani.gif \"Connectivity\")\r\n\r\n**Thinstation** is a basic and small, yet very powerful, Open Source\r\n\"[thin client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client)\" operating\r\nsystem supporting all major connectivity protocols:\r\n*[Citrix](http://citrix.com)* ICA, *[NoMachine](http://nomachine.com)*\r\nNX, *[2X](http://2x.com)* ThinClient,\r\n*[Microsoft](http://microsoft.com)* Windows terminal services (RDP, via\r\nRDesktop), *[VMWare](http://vmware.com/products/view/)* View [Open\r\nclient](http://code.google.com/p/vmware-view-open-client/),\r\n*[Cendio](http://cendio.com)* ThinLinc,\r\n[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantella,_Inc>. Tarantella],\r\n[X](http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/),\r\n[telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet),\r\n[tn5250](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tn5250),\r\n[VMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) terminal and\r\n[SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (No special\r\nconfiguration of the application servers is needed to use Thinstation).\r\n\r\n**Thinstation** is mainly intended for schoolroom, office, company or\r\ndepartment use, but can be used at home (eg. for a silent PC in the\r\nbedroom that 'runs' XP on your workstation in the back room).\r\n\r\nWhilst **Thinstation** is based on Linux, users may actually never see\r\nLinux at all. If you decide to connect directly to a Microsoft Windows,\r\nCitrix or Unix server, the user will feel that they are running directly\r\non the server. But, you can also have a local Desktop interface (with a\r\nlocal Browser & other tools).\r\n\r\n**Thinstation** supports a *Microsoft* Windows-only environment and\r\nREQUIRES NO UNIX/Linux KNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\n**Thinstation** runs on ordinary PC hardware (32/64 bit i686 class). You\r\nmay either reuse older computers or save a lot of time on workstation\r\nadministration. Or both! An old Pentium-II with 128 MB RAM or better can\r\nbe a perfectly useful workstation. And you don't need a hard disk - you\r\ncan boot off the network and even have a silent workstation. Workstation\r\ndevices (floppy/HD/CD/USB) and printers (LPT/USB) are supported.\r\n\r\n**Thinstation** can be booted from network (e.g. diskless) using\r\nEtherboot/PXE or from a local floppy/CD/HD/flash-disk, and prebuilt\r\nimages and a Live CD are available. The thin client configuration can be\r\nlocal or centralized to simplify management.\r\n\r\nThe latest stable release is [version\r\n5.2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/thinstation/files/thinstation/thinstation-5/)\r\nPlease be aware that not all docs have been updated yet but all basic\r\nconcepts apply.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about **Thinstation**, please\r\n\r\n-   review [Getting Started with Thinstation](Getting Started with Thinstation \"wikilink\"),\r\n-   read the [FAQ](FAQ \"wikilink\"),\r\n-   look at the [FAQ + (Common Questions & Answers)](Q&A \"wikilink\"),\r\n-   search through the\r\n    [thinstation-general](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=thinstation-general)\r\n    mailing list archive and even\r\n    [subscribe](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/thinstation-general)\r\n    to participate.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
