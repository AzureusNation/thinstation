{"name":"Thinstation","tagline":"A framework for making thin and light Linux based images for x86 based machines and thinclients.","body":"[[Image:Ani.gif|right|Connectivity]]\r\n\r\n'''Thinstation''' is a basic and small, yet very powerful, Open Source \"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client thin client]\" operating system supporting all major connectivity protocols: ''[http://citrix.com Citrix]'' ICA, ''[http://nomachine.com NoMachine]'' NX, ''[http://2x.com 2X]'' ThinClient, ''[http://microsoft.com Microsoft]'' Windows terminal services (RDP, via RDesktop), ''[http://vmware.com/products/view/ VMWare]'' View [http://code.google.com/p/vmware-view-open-client/ Open client], ''[http://cendio.com Cendio]'' ThinLinc, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantella,_Inc. Tarantella], [http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/ X], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet telnet], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tn5250 tn5250], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS VMS] terminal and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell SSH] (No special configuration of the application servers is needed to use Thinstation). \r\n\r\n'''Thinstation''' is mainly intended for schoolroom, office, company or department use, but can be used at home (eg. for a silent PC in the bedroom that 'runs' XP on your workstation in the back room).\r\n\r\nWhilst '''Thinstation''' is based on Linux, users may actually never see Linux at all. If you decide to connect directly to a Microsoft Windows, Citrix or Unix server, the user will feel that they are running directly on the server. But, you can also have a local Desktop interface (with a local Browser & other tools).\r\n\r\n'''Thinstation''' supports a ''Microsoft'' Windows-only environment and REQUIRES NO UNIX/Linux KNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\n'''Thinstation''' runs on ordinary PC hardware (32/64 bit i686 class). You may either reuse older computers or save a lot of time on workstation administration. Or both! An old Pentium-II with 128 MB RAM or better can be a perfectly useful workstation. And you don't need a hard disk - you can boot off the network and even have a silent workstation. Workstation devices (floppy/HD/CD/USB) and printers (LPT/USB) are supported.\r\n\r\n'''Thinstation''' can be booted from network (e.g. diskless) using Etherboot/PXE or from a local floppy/CD/HD/flash-disk, and prebuilt images and a Live CD are available. The thin client configuration can be local or centralized to simplify management.\r\n\r\nThe latest stable release is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/thinstation/files/thinstation/thinstation-5/ version 5.0] Please be aware that not all docs have been updated yet but all basic concepts apply.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about '''Thinstation''', please\r\n* read the [[FAQ]],\r\n* look at the [[Q&A|FAQ + (Common Questions & Answers)]],\r\n* explore the [[thinstation:Community_Portal|Community Portal]], and\r\n* search through the [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=thinstation-general thinstation-general] mailing list archive and even [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/thinstation-general subscribe] to participate.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
